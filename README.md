# Gravity Forms Advanced Select Field

This plugin adds three multi select fields to Gravity Forms, enhanced with the [Tom Select](https://tom-select.js.org/) UI control: 

1. Manual Multi Select — user defined options
2. Post Multi Select — dynamic options populated from one or more post types
3. Term Multi Select — dynamic options populated from one or more taxonomies

Post Multi Select and Term Multi Select fields support loading paginated options via the REST API. This setting can be enabled by selecting "Virtual Scroll" in the UI Settings.
